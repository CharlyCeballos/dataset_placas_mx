# Is necesary install this ↓

```sh
pip install beautifulsoup4 selenium pandas pyarrow Pillow requests
``` 
The Pillow library will process the images, and the requests library will send HTTP requests. Additionally, the PyArrow library is required as a dependency for pandas.

Additionally, we’ll use built-in Python packages, such as io, pathlib, and hashlib, to download images from a website and store them in a specified folder.
